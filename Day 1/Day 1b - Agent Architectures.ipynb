Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

You pour hours into crafting solutions, only to find they struggle under pressure or are a nightmare to maintain. The secret to writing elegant, efficient, and scalable software often lies in understanding a fundamental set of tools: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Think of them as the foundational blueprints and precise machinery that power the most impressive digital creations. Ignoring DSA is like trying to build a skyscraper with a plastic shovel – you might get there eventually, but it’s going to be a lot harder and the result will likely be less impressive.\n\n### Building Better Software, Faster\n\nAt its core, learning DSA is about building better software. How? Firstly, it hones your **enhanced problem-solving** skills. DSA provides a structured, logical framework for dissecting complex challenges into smaller, more manageable components. This approach leads to more robust, well-thought-out, and less error-prone solutions. Secondly, it’s about **optimized performance**. Understanding how different data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs) store and organize data, and how various algorithms (like sorting and searching) process it, allows you to choose the most efficient tool for any given task. This direct impact on your program's speed and resource usage is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets. Finally, DSA teaches you about **scalability**. In today's world, applications need to grow. Learning DSA equips you with the knowledge to design systems that can gracefully handle increasing amounts of data and user traffic without buckling under the strain.\n\n### Elevating Your Development Career\n\nBeyond the technical advantages, a solid grasp of DSA can significantly propel your career. Perhaps the most immediate benefit is **mastering technical interviews**. A strong understanding of DSA is almost universally a prerequisite for landing a software development role at top tech companies. It's often seen as the universal language of efficient coding, a benchmark for a candidate's fundamental programming prowess. Furthermore, it makes you a **more valuable team member**. By understanding and implementing best practices for code efficiency and maintainability, you contribute more effectively to team projects, earning the trust and respect of your colleagues. This elevated contribution can also **open doors to advanced roles**. Many specialized and high-demand fields within software engineering, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, deep backend development, and competitive programming, heavily rely on advanced DSA concepts.\n\n### The \"Why\" Behind the \"How\"\n\nIt's important to remember that learning DSA isn't just about memorizing implementations or solving a few LeetCode problems. It's about **understanding the fundamentals** – the underlying principles of how data is organized, accessed, and manipulated, and how computational steps can be executed efficiently. This deeper insight into computer science is invaluable. It cultivates **algorithmic thinking**, a crucial mindset that constantly seeks the most efficient and elegant path to a solution, rather than settling for the first one that comes to mind. Most importantly, in a tech landscape that is constantly evolving, DSA is about **future-proofing your skills**. While programming languages, frameworks, and tools may change, the core concepts of data organization and algorithmic efficiency remain constant, making your skillset evergreen and adaptable.\n\nInvesting time in learning Data Structures and Algorithms is not just about passing interviews; it's about fundamentally improving your craft as a software developer. It's about building the confidence and capability to tackle any coding challenge with elegance and efficiency, ultimately making you a more powerful and indispensable force in the tech world.\nEditorAgent > ## Unlock Your Coding Superpowers: Why Data Structures & Algorithms Are Your Secret Weapon\n\nEver feel like your code is clunky, slow, or just not quite *there*?

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-16T14:19:10.270030Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-16T14:19:10.270448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-16T14:19:10.277025Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-16T14:19:10.270420Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-16T14:19:10.275978Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

A sentence or two showing him grappling with the implications would add emotional depth.\n2.  **Hint at the Map's Origin or Purpose (Subtly):** The map is clearly not of this world. While its mystery is its strength, a tiny, almost subconscious detail could be added to hint at its origin or why it might be hidden in *his* lighthouse. Perhaps the leathery material feels strangely familiar, or the glowing lines echo a pattern he's seen in the constellations, or even in the way the light refracts through the lens under specific conditions. This would tie the map more directly to Silas's environment.\n3.  **Consider the \"Promise\":** The final sentence mentions a \"promise of worlds beyond his lonely light.\" The story could be slightly more impactful by briefly contrasting this promise with his current reality. For example, does he feel a pang of regret for his solitary life, or a surge of excitement that his solitude has led him to such a discovery?\nRefinerAgent > Old Silas, his beard a tangled grey nest, polished the great lens. For fifty years, this tower had been his world, a predictable cycle of sea-whispered secrets and the rhythmic sweep of light. Tonight, however, the usual low hum vibrated with an unusual insistence. He noticed it then, tucked beneath a loose floorboard: a rolled parchment, brittle with age.\n\nWith a tremor in his calloused fingers, Silas unfurled it. He gasped, not just at the sight, but at a sudden, inexplicable resonance within him. It wasn’t paper, but some strange, leathery material that felt oddly like the ancient seals on ships’ manifests he’d once handled, yet it pulsed with an inner light. Ethereal lines glowed, forming continents he didn't recognize, oceans marked with shimmering currents that mirrored the phosphorescence he sometimes saw on the darkest nights.
